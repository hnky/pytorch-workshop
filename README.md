# Train and deploy a PyTorch model using the Azure Machine Learning platform.

In this hands-on lab you are going to build and deploy your own trained vision model to a highly scalable endpoint using Azure Machine Learning.
You start with setting up your cloud workspace and learn how to manage your data and make it reusable. Next you will train a PyTorch model using the transfer learning approach and finally you deploy the model wrapped in an API in a managed endpoint.

At the end of this hands-on lab you have gone through the complete life-cycle of a model, from data to deployment using the Azure Machine Learning platform.
